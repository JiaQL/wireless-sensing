\title{Sensing Our World Using Wireless Signals}


\author{}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
In the last few years, pervasive wireless signals have been established as a powerful medium for ubiquitous sensing. %By carefully processing the variation of the signal reflected from the human target, rich information ranging from coarse-grained body activity to fine-grained hand gesture and even vital signs can now be accurately  sensed without any device attached to the human body. 
Wireless sensing quickly becomes an active cross-disciplinary research area which involves wireless communication, signal processing, human-computer interaction, machine learning and even hardware design. This article serves as an introduction to this exciting area and presents the key technologies enabling it. This article discussed the state-of-the-arts achievements in this field and also the unaddressed research challenges.
