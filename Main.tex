\title{Sensing Our World Using Wireless Signals}


\author{}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
In the last decades, consumer-grade wireless signals have rapidly established itself as a powerful medium for sensing. By measuring how
the wireless signal is affected by objects and human activities, rich information ranging from gestures to gait patterns and even vital
signs can be identified. This article provides an accessible introduction to wireless sensing. It presents the key enabling technology of
this exciting research field and its main achievements. It provides a discussion on open issues in the area and potential research
directions.
