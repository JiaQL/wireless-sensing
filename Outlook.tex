\section{Future research trends}

In view of the state-of-arts and practical applications, we expect the future research in wireless sensing to follow two trends. \textbf{(i) Towards complex sensing scenarios.} Typical applications include in-body localization, through-wall imaging, sensing of high-speed mobile object (high-speed rail, driverless vehicle, UAV), etc. \textbf{(ii) Integrating sensing with communication.} By combining the advantages of sensing and communication, we can achieve more amazing sensing and communication technologies such as cross-medium, cross-protocol, cross-frequency.
We believe the potential solutions would focus on combining multiple means (multiple signals, multiple devices, active and passive, model and deep learning) and multidimensional parameter estimation.
