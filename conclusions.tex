\section{CONCLUSION}\label{sec:8conc}
This article has introduced wireless sensing methods built upon consumer-grade solutions. After much progress has been made in the last
decade or so, wireless sensing is now a mainstream research area and has a large amount of academic interest and papers. While it is
impossible to provide a definitive cataloguer of all relevant research, we have tried to give an accessible tutorial to the main research
topics, challenges and future trends. Wireless sensing is still at its early stage.  There are many challenges ahead, but there are
much greater opportunities for creative and high-impact research to be conducted in this exciting direction.
